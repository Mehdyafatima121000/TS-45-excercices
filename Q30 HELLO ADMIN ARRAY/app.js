//Hello Admin: Make a array of five or more usernames, including the name 'admin'. Imagine you are writing code that will print a greeting to each user after they log in to a website. Loop through the array, and print a greeting to each user:
//• If the username is 'admin', print a special greeting, such as Hello admin, would you like to see a status report?
//• Otherwise, print a generic greeting, such as Hello Eric, thank you for logging in again.
var users = ['peehu', 'meehu', 'batota', 'sheru', 'admin'];
for (var _i = 0, users_1 = users; _i < users_1.length; _i++) {
    var user = users_1[_i];
    if (user === "admin") {
        console.log("Hello admin, would you like to see a status report?");
    }
    else {
        console.log("Hello ".concat(user, ", thankyou for logging in again."));
    }
}
